Note: All metrics below are the result of taking difference of Home and Away, thus d_Sacks was generated by Sacks_Home - d_Away… The target variable is HomeWin.

If you are not familiar with the game of football, this data dictionary will only be slightly helpful…however I hope that it defines the variables enough for you to follow.
