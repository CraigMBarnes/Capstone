There are two source files in this directory. <br>
The first is an R script, that will execute a webscript and pull down NFL stats from each game for past 5+ years. <br>
The second is the csv result from the last execution of the above script. <br>
It is the output from 12/1/2020, so the most recent game was played 11/30/2020. <br>
