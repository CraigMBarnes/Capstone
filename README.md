HarvardX Capstone <br>
There are a number of source files in this directory. <br>
There is an R script, that will execute a web-scraping r-code that will pull down NFL stats from each game for past 5+ years. <br>
The second is the csv result from the last execution of the above script. <br>
You will also find "Capstone - xxxx" files, that denote my R, Rmarkdown, and PDF files.
